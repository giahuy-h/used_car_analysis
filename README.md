### Important features of a used car

The goal of this project is to use a dataset that contains various attributes of used cars and their corresponding prices to train linear regression models and predict the price, and thus identify the key features that are valuable to the customers.

The analysis reveals **age**, **odometer**, **fuel diesel** and **12 cylinders** are the key drivers that affect the car prices. There are also values in old vintage cars.

These insights can help dealerships to fine-tune their inventory and design appropriate marketing material that emphasize on the important features.
- Predicted prices from the models can be used to cross-check against the current listing to identify mispricings.
- Dealers can spealize in certain cars that have higher values.
- Marketing poster or advertisement can feature the important attributes prominently to attract more customers.
